## Examples

1. Post: I've always believed in the power of research to save lives and ensure
   Americans get the care they need. Starting today, the firstever White House
   Initiative on Women's Health Research will work towards that goal, changing
   how we approach and fund women's health research.

2. Post: This little kid was carrying a white flag, and now he's dead. This guy
   was also carrying a white flag, and he's been shot. I'm here filming for you,
   and I'm in a lot of danger as well. People holding white flags are trying to
   come out, and are scared from the snipers. If the claims of civilians with
   white flags getting INTENTIONALLY targeted is true, this would be a WAR
   CRIME.
